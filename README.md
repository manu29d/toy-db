# toy-db

A simple experiment to have a SQL-like db for storing values in memory.
Might be useful for fast prototyping front-end.

### Usage

Just include the `index.js` file to your project. Might be a good idea to rename the file.

Make sure you `import` or `require` properly.

See [`test.js`](./blobl/master/test.js) for more usage information.
